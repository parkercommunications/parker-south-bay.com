	<h4>Reporting</h4>
	<p>	Every time we remotely add/delete/ or change voice mail users for you we deliver a voice mail report that we
		examine and hightlight suspected issues (user A has 15 new messages and has not logged in 2 months).
		Extension lists, voicemail usage, Telephone number lists, and more are available upon request</p>

	<h4>System Audit</h4>
	<p>	Parker engineers examine your system for correct installation of hardware, current firmware and
		software revisions, application programming, user directions, user training, and even the phones
		button labeling.</p>

	<br />
	<h4>New Building Audit</h4>
	<p>	Parker engineers can test your new facility cabling, create a cable map, and help you plan where you
		need additional cabling if any.  We can cable your voice and data needs as well as plan and build your
		racks and server room.</p>

	<br />
	<h4>Service Contracts</h4>
	<p>	Generally speaking, we provide our customers the benefits of a service contract without having to pay for
		it on a monthly basis as we provide timely maintenance, upgrades, and emergency service at an hourly rate.
		You pay only for the service you receive as the Toshiba can go for months and years with no service required.
		We are loyal to our customers who purchase and maintain their Toshiba equipment exclusively with Parker.
		We will extend this service to select take-overs as well.</p>

	<p>	Toshiba is a wonderfully reliable system.  Toshiba and Parker Communications offer a 2 years parts and
		warranty for system purchases including emergency and standard on site service for both parts and labor.
		An optional parts only factory sponsored maintenance warranty is available to extend the parts warranty
		from 2 to 5 or from 2 to 7 years.  This must be purchased at the time the system is purchased but costs
		less than most other competitors’ required annual maintenance costs.  The 7 year warranty gives you the
		peace of mind that while you are not paying a monthly maintenance charge, any big ticket electronics are
		still covered.  The customer is responsible for the labor to diagnose and correct the problem.<p>

	<p> Other brands require mandatory annual maintenance from 10 to 18 percent per year.  Often this gives you
		only hardware warranty and allows your vendor tech support.  You are still responsible for labor.</p>
