<p>Toshiba's VIPedge cloud-based business telephone solution is designed for organizations needing robust
   unified communications features without having to own and maintain a telephone system.</p>
<p>VIPedge offers a solution a solution alternative to buying a telephone system.  Customers pay a recurring monthly service
   fee, based upon size and usage, instead of purchasing or leasing the telephone system.</p>
<p>The VIPedge business solution provides the same industry-leading, feature-rich functionality as an on-premise
   Toshiba IPedge business telephone system.  The VIPedge phones will be the envy of the cloud phone systems.</p>
<p>The VIPedge is a complete business telephone system with Voice Mail with Unified Messaging, Mobility, and Call Manager (PC GUI
   provides presence, IM/Chat, and call control from your PC).</p>
<p>For your success Toshiba requires your Internet to be Business Quality (T1s, Business Class Cable, Metro Ethernet or Better - NO DSL!).
   Toshiba also requires they supply the edge router for this Internet connection and that the customer LAN passes a network
   assessment.</p>

<h2>VIPedge FAQs:</h2>
<p> 1) Will the customer be able to port some/all his telephone numbers off the system during or when they leave VIPedge including both numbers the customer ported onto the VIPedge as well as new Toshiba numbers that were assigned?</br>
       <font color="red">Yes<font color="black"</p>


<p> 2) Is our billing six seconds or minutes rounded up or something else?</br>
       <font color="red"> 1 minute <font color="black"></p>

<p> 3) Please explain the details of the 1200 minutes for non-call center unlimited channels:</br>
       For example:</br>
	   Do inbound calls to standard channels count against the 1200 minutes:</br>
       Local ?<font color="red"> yes <font color="black"> </br>
Long Distance ? yes
International ? yes
	   Do the unlimited local outbound calls count against the 1200 minutes? yes
	   Do outbound long distance counts against the 1200 minues? yes
   Do international calls count against the 1200 minutes?
	Inbound? yes
	Outbound? No – outbound international calls are billed separately.

4)  The current call center standard plan seems to have absolutely nothing free:
	Just $.019 /minute in/out? in and out

5) Why not simplify and toss the “Call Center” Tier and just have caps and tolls beyond on a month
     by month basis?  Seems easier and fair to supplier and customer.
The advantage of the unlimited type is that the customer won’t be billed for going over, for the next month they will have the option of buying more channels of service or switching over to the call  center type.

6)  How is that free pre-install/post QOS network assessment offer coming?
It is coming soon.

7) What is the minimum size order?
	How many phones? 1
	How many channels? 1
	Deposit starts at $50.
Is customer forced to buy an approved router? They are not forced to buy it, but they are required to have it.
	Is there any thing else that must be purchased or customer has to prove?
Through a network assessment, it must be demonstrated that the network is able to deliver at least 99% of voice packets

8) What if customer downsizes?  At one point you said 50% still due to end of term.  What if customer
     downsizes then 2 months later upsizes? Does that undo the 50% penalty from the downsize for
     remaining months?)
No penalty to down size.  Able to add/remove under agreement as required.

9) What if the customer adds stuff to the system.  Is the term of the account 24 months past start, 24 months
     past last add, or 24 months of each item added from the time it is added? E.g. only order past start at 20 months adds 4 phones – so does the term end at 24, 44, or they only need to keep 4 phones at month 25 to 44, or something else?
24 months past start. The only exception is if the customer purchases another server. That will have its own star date.

10) Do all tolls for call centers come from deposit account?
Yes

11) If deposit does not have an auto-renew, does system prevent outbound/inbound calls immediately?
       What do customer’s callers hear?
If the auto-renew is stopped, long distance calls will be blocked. The service will continue for a short time and the dealer will be notified.

12) Could you consider offering contiguous blocks of DID numbers for a price like most all DID providers?
We will investigate it.

13) Can we sell phones /other items from our stock or must all phones come from TAIS directly to keep serial numbers straight?
Customers are not required to buy phones through the portal at incredibly discounted prices, but they can not buy more phones than they are buying services for.

14) Is the only difference between standard and toll free users/aa-mailboes is that it determines what type of phone number is bundled with it?
Yes

15) Is it true that the bundled number has no restrictions with it and is simply added to the pool of available numbers in the system?
??? I am not clear on this question?

16) Can a system have only Toll Free channels on it and still make calls out?
Yes

17) If a customer already has IP5000 (not 9 line models) series phones can we allow them on the system?
Currently, the software required for the non-9-line-IP5000 phones is not available. But it will be possible – but not recommended.

18) What can we do with the MP112/2S/SIP Gateway on the VIPedge price sheet?
It’s there for fax machines, hasn’t been tested yet for other things like single line telephones and paging.

19) How are the installation rates for defined items applied (automatic vs. optionally dealer entered)?
    Eg. V-IN-USER.
You (the dealer) can use this charge to cover installation of the phones (one each per phone). You can also use the V-INSTALL-OD part number to cover additional installation charges in increments of $10.

20) Do AA mailboxes have automatic or suggested/fixed labor?
It is up to the dealer to determine the cost for installation labor. Beyond the basic V-IN-USER charge, the additional labor cost divided by 10 should be entered in the portal as the V-INSTALL-OD quantity.

21) So a customer gets several mailboxes for menus, and departments, and several message lights on
several phones for each department.  How do you see labor being billed for these?
This is for the dealer to determine the labor costs, and use the V-IN-USER and V-INSTALL-OD to cover the costs.

22) Is there any thought about listing more than one dealer in the VIPedge Quote dealer locater?  Our dealership is against the edge of the metro area and another dealer several miles toward the metro area will get every referral.  Perhaps listing multiple dealers by mileage range (even short like, 30 miles) would be more fair.
??? to be answered by marketing.

23) Could you provide several examples of typical installation charges?
Please see the answer to #20 and let us know if there is still a question.

24) Can customer self install or prepare his own network (router/ switch QOS) like other cloud systems?
The customer must provide its own network and switch. The customer must use one of the supported routers either buying it through the portal, or obtaining it themselves.

25) When is VIPedge Call Manger going to be released so it can support the VoIP phone feature?
It is available.
