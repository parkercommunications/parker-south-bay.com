<p>Toshiba's VIPedge cloud-based business telephone solution is designed for organizations needing robust
   unified communications features without having to own and maintain a telephone system.</p>

<p>VIPedge offers a solution a solution alternative to buying a telephone system.  Customers pay a recurring monthly service
   fee, based upon size and usage, instead of purchasing or leasing the telephone system.</p>

<p>The VIPedge business solution provides the same industry-leading, feature-rich functionality as an on-premise
   Toshiba IPedge business telephone system.  The VIPedge phones will be the envy of the cloud phone systems.</p>

<p>The VIPedge is a complete business telephone system with Voice Mail with Unified Messaging, Mobility, and Call Manager (PC GUI
   provides presence, IM/Chat, call control from your PC, and iPhone and Android Cell Phone Apps).</p>

<p>For your success Toshiba desires your Internet to be Business Quality (T1s, Business Class Cable, Metro Ethernet or Better - No DSLs).
   However, we have used some DSL's successfully (Depends on your distrance from the Telco, speed, number of users, shared with QOS router,
   or 2nd DSL just for the CLOUD, etc.)
   Toshiba also desires they supply the edge router for this Internet connection (if you share it with data) and that the customer LAN passes a network
   assessment (free).</p>

<h2> Why the Toshiba CLOUD is better</h2>

<p> Toshiba is a $75 Billion dollar company has been in USA Business Telecom for since the 1960s. We are a full featured business telephone system. We offer
the power of traditional PBXs and feature rich Key-Hyrid systems.  This experience and feature sets is vastly superior to the stripped down simple VoIP offerings
of most VoIP or CLOUD systems on the market.
</p>

<p>We use Megaco instead of SIP (Skinny IP).  This allows us to bring you 20 feature keys on top of 10 fixed keys and 4 soft keys.  Toshiba's
phones electronicly label the 10+10 feature keys. Compare this to most SIP phones that typicaly only have 2 to 6 buttons that offer striped
down features and requires use of menus or feature codes to do the simplest things.
</p>

<p>Toshiba is fair!  We do NOT renew your term every time you make a change to your system!  You can downsize to 1 phone and 1 line ($45/mo). If you ever
leave Toshiba you can take your phone numbers with you (many CLOUD systems do not allow this).
</p>

<p>We are great for seasonal businesses as you can add as many phones and lines for a peak selling period(s) without term requirements.
</p>

<p>You can turn your CLOUD system into a premise system without penalties with the same programming and features. Not many if any can
offer you this.
</p>

<p>Toshiba CLOUD system is only offered through a subset of the Toshiba's local Telecom dealer network just like our premise based systems.  Toshiba keeps
strick control of dealers and insures that all dealerships have training, parts, emergency service, and move a lot of product so each is familiar
with the product.
</p>

<p> Toshiba has local on-site factory trained technicians and salesman just a phone call away. How many (if any) CLOUD companies have local
staff to come visit you on site if you need it?
</p>

<p>Toshiba's CLOUD system is exactly the same as our premise VoIP system (IPedge).  We built them from the ground up. We did NOT purchase
a dead DOT com or small VoIP company to offer a CLOUD solution along with our premise system choices.
</p>

<p> Toshiba's CLOUD includes 12 simulaneous call through voice mail.
</p>

<p> Toshiba's CLOUD allows 4 line Bursting of incomming or outgoing calls or simulaneous cell phone or cell phone ringing.  For example you
can have a 1 phone/ 1 line system that can take 5 calls simultaneously.
</p>

<h2> Why is getting Toshiba's CLOUD (VIPedge) from Parker better than other Toshiba Dealers? </h2>

<p> Toshiba VIPedge has a default programming scheme that can keep installation costs low.  However, we improve on this scheme for all of our
customers.  This includes reducing the default 4 digit extensions to a more resonable customer schemes at no additional cost (example 2 or 3 digit
extensions, keeping your existing number scheeme, or matching the DID phone numbers).  We also reduce the 4 digit VM access to a single digit.
</p>

<p> Most of our customers need to do absoluting nothing in terms of programming their system as they have us turnkey it for them.
</p>

<p> We supply a custom 6 page user guide specific to your company.  Most will just supply you a .pdf of the generic 234 page user guide.

<h2>VIPedge FAQs:</h2>
<p> 1) Will the customer be able to port some/all his telephone numbers off the system during or when they leave VIPedge including both numbers the customer ported onto the VIPedge as well as new Toshiba numbers that were assigned?</br>
       <font color="red">Yes<font color="black"</p>


<p> 2) Is our billing six seconds or minutes rounded up or something else?</br>
       <font color="red"> 1 minute <font color="black"></p>

<p> 3) Please explain the details of the 1200 minutes for non-call center unlimited channels:</br>
       For example:</br>
       <DL>
			<DT>Do inbound calls to standard channels count against the 1200 minutes:</br></DT>
				<DD>Local ?<font color="red"> yes <font color="black"> </br></DD>
				<DD>Long Distance ? <font color="red"> yes <font color="black"> </DD>
				<DD>International ? <font color="red"> yes <font color="black"> </DD>
			<DT>Do the unlimited local outbound calls count against the 1200 minutes?<font color="red"> yes <font color="black"> </DT>
	   		<DT>Do outbound long distance counts against the 1200 minues? <font color="red"> yes <font color="black"> </DT>

				<DD>Outbound? <font color="red"> No.  Outbound international calls are billed separately. <font color="black"> </DD>
		</DL></p>


<p> 4) The current call center standard plan seems to have absolutely nothing free: Just $.019 /minute in/out? </br>
		<font color="red"> yes <font color="black"> </p>

<p> 5) Why not simplify and toss the "Call Center" Tier and just have caps and tolls beyond on a month
       by month basis?  Seems easier and fair to supplier and customer.</br>
		<font color="red"> The advantage of the unlimited type is that the customer won’t be billed for going over, for the next month they will have the option of buying more channels of service or switching over to the call  center type. <font color="black"></p>

<p> 6) How is that free pre-install/post QOS network assessment offer coming?</br>
		<font color="red"> It is coming soon. <font color="black"></p>

<DL>
	<DT> 7) What is the minimum size order?</DT>
		<DD> How many phones? <font color="red"> 1 <font color="black"> </DD>
		<DD> How many channels? <font color="red"> 1 <font color="black"> </DD>
		<DD> What is term? <font color="red"> 24 months <font color="black"> </DD>
		<DD> Deposit starts at? <font color="red"> $50 <font color="black"> </DD>
		<DD> Customer is required to have an approved router? <font color="red"> Yes, they can already own it, buy it, or purchase from Toshiba. <font color="black"> </DD>
		<DD> Network Assessment? <font color="red"> Required!  It must be demonstrated that the network is able to deliver at least 99% of voice packets <font color="black"></DD>
	</DT></DL>

<p> 8) What if customer downsizes? </br>
		<font color="red"> No penalty to down size.  Able to add/remove under agreement as required.<font color="black"> </p>

<p> 9) What if the customer adds items to the system - Does the 24 month term extend? </br>
		<font color="red">No, the only exception is if the customer purchases another server. That will have its own star date. <font color="black"> </p>

<p> 10) Do all tolls for call centers come from deposit account?</br>
		<font color="red"> Yes <font color="black"> </p>

<p> 11) If deposit does not have an auto-renew OR exceeds the 2 per day refill does system prevent outbound/inbound calls immediately?</br>
		<font color="red"> If the desposit is exhaused long distance calls will be blocked. The service will continue for a short time and the dealer will be notified.<font color="black"></p>

<p> 12) Could you consider offering contiguous blocks of DID numbers for a price ?</br>
		<font color="red"> Parker has suggested this to Toshiba. <font color="black"> </p>

<p> 14) Is the only difference between standard and toll free users/aa-mailboes is that it determines what type of phone number is bundled with it? </br>
		<font color="red"> Yes <font color="black"> </p>

<p> 15) Is it true that the bundled numbers has no restrictions on what they are used for in the system? </br>
		<font color="red"> Yes <font color="black"> </p>

<p> 16) Can a system have only Toll Free channels on it and still make calls out?</br>
		<font color="red"> Yes <font color="black"></p>

<p> 17) If a customer already has Toshiba IP5000 (not 9 line models) series phones can we allow them on the system? </br>
		<font color="red"> Currently, the software required for the non-9-line-IP5000 phones is not available. Later it will be possible but not recommended. <font color="black"> </p>

<p> 18) What can we do with the MP112/2S/SIP Gateway on the VIPedge price sheet? </br>
		<font color="red"> It’s there for fax machines, hasn’t been tested yet for other things like single line telephones and paging.<font color="black"></p>

<p> 19) How are the installation rates applied ? </br>
		<font color="red"> There is a basic $49 per phone set up fee.  Beyond that any addional customization, network assessment, network improvement, additional cabling, etc. is bid and billed. <font color="black"> </p>
