<p>Toshiba's VIPedge cloud-based business telephone solution is designed for organizations needing robust
   unified communications features without having to own and maintain a telephone system.</p>
<p>VIPedge offers a solution a solution alternative to buying a telephone system.  Customers pay a recurring monthly service
   fee, based upon size and usage, instead of purchasing or leasing the telephone system.</p>
<p>The VIPedge business solution provides the same industry-leading, feature-rich functionality as an on-premise
   Toshiba IPedge business telephone system.  The VIPedge phones will be the envy of the cloud phone systems.</p>
<p>The VIPedge is a complete business telephone system with Voice Mail with Unified Messaging, Mobility, and Call Manager (PC GUI
   provides presence, IM/Chat, and call control from your PC).</p>
<p>For your success Toshiba requires your Internet to be Business Quality (T1s, Business Class Cable, Metro Ethernet or Better - NO DSL!).
   Toshiba also requires they supply the edge router for this Internet connection and that the customer LAN passes a network
   assessment.</p>

<h2>VIPedge FAQs:</h2>
<p> 1) Will the customer be able to port some/all his telephone numbers off the system during or when they leave VIPedge including both numbers the customer ported onto the VIPedge as well as new Toshiba numbers that were assigned?</br>
       <font color="red">Yes<font color="black"</p>


<p> 2) Is our billing six seconds or minutes rounded up or something else?</br>
       <font color="red"> 1 minute <font color="black"></p>

<p> 3) Please explain the details of the 1200 minutes for non-call center unlimited channels:</br>
       For example:</br>
       <DL>
			<DT>Do inbound calls to standard channels count against the 1200 minutes:</br></DT>
				<DD>Local ?<font color="red"> yes <font color="black"> </br></DD>
				<DD>Long Distance ? <font color="red"> yes <font color="black"> </DD>
				<DD>International ? <font color="red"> yes <font color="black"> </DD>
			<DT>Do the unlimited local outbound calls count against the 1200 minutes?<font color="red"> yes <font color="black"> </DT>
	   		<DT>Do outbound long distance counts against the 1200 minues? <font color="red"> yes <font color="black"> </DT>
   			<DT>Do international calls count against the 1200 minutes?</DT>
				<DD>Inbound? <font color="red"> yes <font color="black"> </DD>
				<DD>Outbound? <font color="red"> No.  Outbound international calls are billed separately. <font color="black"> </DD>
		</DL></p>


<p> 4) The current call center standard plan seems to have absolutely nothing free: Just $.019 /minute in/out? </br>
		<font color="red"> yes <font color="black"> </p>

<p> 5) Why not simplify and toss the "Call Center" Tier and just have caps and tolls beyond on a month
       by month basis?  Seems easier and fair to supplier and customer.</br>
		<font color="red"> The advantage of the unlimited type is that the customer won’t be billed for going over, for the next month they will have the option of buying more channels of service or switching over to the call  center type. <font color="black"></p>

<p> 6) How is that free pre-install/post QOS network assessment offer coming?</br>
		<font color="red"> It is coming soon. <font color="black"></p>

<DL>
	<DT> 7) What is the minimum size order?</DT>
		<DD> How many phones? <font color="red"> 1 <font color="black"> </DD>
		<DD> How many channels? <font color="red"> 1 <font color="black"> </DD>
		<DD> What is term? <font color="red"> 24 months <font color="black"> </DD>
		<DD> Deposit starts at? <font color="red"> $50 <font color="black"> </DD>
		<DD> Customer is required to have an approved router? <font color="red"> Yes, they can already own it, buy it, or purchase from Toshiba. <font color="black"> </DD>
		<DD> Network Assessment? <font color="red"> Required!  It must be demonstrated that the network is able to deliver at least 99% of voice packets <font color="black"></DD>
	</DT></DL>

<p> 8) What if customer downsizes? </br>
		<font color="red"> No penalty to down size.  Able to add/remove under agreement as required.<font color="black"> </p>

<p> 9) What if the customer adds items to the system - Does the 24 month term extend? </br>
		<font color="red">No, the only exception is if the customer purchases another server. That will have its own star date. <font color="black"> </p>

<p> 10) Do all tolls for call centers come from deposit account?</br>
		<font color="red"> Yes <font color="black"> </p>

<p> 11) If deposit does not have an auto-renew OR exceeds the 2 per day refill does system prevent outbound/inbound calls immediately?</br>
		<font color="red"> If the desposit is exhaused long distance calls will be blocked. The service will continue for a short time and the dealer will be notified.<font color="black"></p>

<p> 12) Could you consider offering contiguous blocks of DID numbers for a price ?</br>
		<font color="red"> Parker has suggested this to Toshiba. <font color="black"> </p>

<p> 14) Is the only difference between standard and toll free users/aa-mailboes is that it determines what type of phone number is bundled with it? </br>
		<font color="red"> Yes <font color="black"> </p>

<p> 15) Is it true that the bundled numbers has no restrictions on what they are used for in the system? </br>
		<font color="red"> Yes <font color="black"> </p>

<p> 16) Can a system have only Toll Free channels on it and still make calls out?</br>
		<font color="red"> Yes <font color="black"></p>

<p> 17) If a customer already has Toshiba IP5000 (not 9 line models) series phones can we allow them on the system? </br>
		<font color="red"> Currently, the software required for the non-9-line-IP5000 phones is not available. Later it will be possible but not recommended. <font color="black"> </p>

<p> 18) What can we do with the MP112/2S/SIP Gateway on the VIPedge price sheet? </br>
		<font color="red"> It’s there for fax machines, hasn’t been tested yet for other things like single line telephones and paging.<font color="black"></p>

<p> 19) How are the installation rates applied ? </br>
		<font color="red"> There is a basic $49 per phone set up fee.  Beyond that any addional customization, network assessment, network improvement, additional cabling, etc. is bid and billed. <font color="black"> </p>
