<p>Toshiba's VIPedge cloud-based business telephone solution is designed for organizations needing robust
   unified communications features without having to own and maintain a telephone system.</p>
<p>VIPedge offers a solution a solution alternative to buying a telephone system.  Customers pay a recurring monthly service
   fee, based upon size and usage, instead of purchasing or leasing the telephone system.</p>
<p>The VIPedge business solution provides the same industry-leading, feature-rich functionality as an on-premise
   Toshiba IPedge business telephone system.  The VIPedge phones will be the envy of the cloud phone systems.</p>
<p>The VIPedge is a complete business telephone system with Voice Mail with Unified Messaging, Mobility, and Call Manager (PC GUI
   provides presence, IM/Chat, and call control from your PC).</p>
<p>For your success Toshiba requires your Internet to be Business Quality (T1s, Business Class Cable, Metro Ethernet or Better - NO DSL!).
   Toshiba also requires they supply the edge router for this Internet connection and that the customer LAN passes a network
   assessment.</p>
