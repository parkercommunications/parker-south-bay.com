<h1>VoIP vs Traditional TDM (digital)</h1>
  <div id=body><p>Should we buy a VoIP system?
	Today, generally speaking, you should NOT buy a VOIP only system.  The same can be said for NOT buying a TDM only system.  You need a system that can do both.  Often, all the phones in the building should be digital.  Additional buildings close by should be linked with digital TDM ISDN PRIs.  At some distance the monthly cost will be too much and it then makes sense to use VoIP to connect them.   Whether the additional sites(s) have VoIP off the primary PBX or are linked PBX’s is a design question.  Single or a small groups of offsite users usually  require VoIP.

	There are exceptions to any rule. For example, The “IP Mobility” feature allows a user with multiple VoIP phones (home, office, laptop) to log in at a different location and “bump” off his previous location.   Using Digital phones you would have 2 	separate extensions and have calls ring at both at the same time (not quite the same experience and has less flexibility)  Let a Parker sales engineer help you reach the optimum configuration.

Does VoIP or TDM offer more features?
	Today the user experience of a VoIP phone and a TDM phone are almost the same.  Today, when features are too complex for a telephone set, features extend to the users PC graphical user interface (GUI).  However, both VoIP and TDM systems can 	do this for the power users.  Somewhere in the future, it is conceivable that the amount of information being delivered to the desk set will require VoIP or perhaps give rise to the TDM/IP hybrid.

Does VoIP give you better quality speech than TDM?
	VoIP on its best day can only give 95 percent of what TDM can deliver.  There are many pitfalls with VoIP that lower its quality.  These pitfalls result in same symptom that 	cellphones have—choppy speech.  These pitfalls can occur on any link of the VoIP chain and are often intermittent, involve many vendors, and can be very expensive to resolve.

How is speech sent?
	The standard for all telephone speech starts off with sampling 	the microphone 8,000 times a second and generating a number between 0 and 255.  This is 64,000 bits per second or 8,000 bytes per second.

	TDM guarantees that every one of these bits is sent promptly from one end to the other.  Once the call is answered, nothing can interfere with the quality or flow until one of the callers hang up.

	VoIP takes these 8,000 bytes of information and sends them raw OR uses an algorithm to compress the 8,000 to 1,000 to 4,000 or so.  It then sends 20-150 of these bytes at a time with 40 bytes of overhead.  This means you need about 84K of up/down bandwidth for corded, TDM sound quality.  With VoIP, the data paths are shared.  VoIP packets are subject to traffic delays and loss, usually because the data is so late it would be useless, choppy speech is the result.

Does VoIP really save in cabling costs?
	Some would say you would save money with a VoIP system when you have to install all new cabling.  There is a term “one wire to the desk” where VoIP manufacturers build a mini-switch 	into the bottom of the phone (Toshiba’s have this feature and with a 1GB speed).  You would think all you would have to do is plug your PCs into the phone and all would be good.  This requires the very latest in quality routers that will route DIFFSERVE and/or the setup of Virtual Lans.  Once
you start down the VLAN path there is costly switch programming and user discipline is required as the jacks in the switch are no longer all the same.  Many top installers of VoIP simply have the customer run 2 data cables so voice and data are separate.

	TDM uses almost any twisted pair telecom cable.  Most small companies who simply want to move into where another tenant was before, will not have to re-cable with TDM.

	There can be 	problems running on 	“QUAD” cabling.  Quad cabling has 4 conductors with out being twisted and has conductors with red, 	green, yellow, and black coloring. It is NOT a twisted pair cable.  It is often found in older buildings or originally installed for alarm systems.

Which is costlier to maintain and/or more reliable?
	TDM problems are easy to diagnose.  There are only 3 things that typically go wrong and only the Telephone vendor is involved.  There is no interaction with any other telephone circuit since each path is unique and separate.  TDM networking (using point to point PRIs using T1s ) are multi-vendor but have self testing and fault detection built in.

	VoIP is much harder and costlier to diagnose.  Any device on the network or the Internet can be the problem.  All activity of VoIP and non-VoIP equipment can be the source of the issues.  There are dozens of interacting intermittent possibilities. There can be lots of equipment, companies, and programming involved.  Expensive network assessments costs thousands for a couple of hours of testing that may or may not see your intermittent issue. Lots of finger pointing possibilities exist.


Power Failures and VoIP:
	VoIP requires electrical power in many places to work.  Each 	phone needs a power with a cube OR expensive Power Over Ethernet (POE) switches.  The PBX, all switches, Routers, ISP edge equipment  -  they all need electrical power.  You must provide battery backup at every location where one of these devices resides.

	TDM systems often have a single battery backup 	device.  The PBX supplies power to all of its phones.  The phone company powers both TDM analog and digital circuits.
