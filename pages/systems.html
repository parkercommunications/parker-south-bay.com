<h1>Current Toshiba Phone Systems</h1>
<div id=body>
<p>Parker Communications is proud to offer Toshiba products exclusively.
Toshiba's line of telecommunication products is flexible, powerful, broad, reliable, feature rich, and long lasting.</p>

<h2>Toshiba has 2 families of phone systems:</h2>
<h3>The CIX (100% TDM OR 100% VoIP OR anything inbetween).</h3>
<h3>The IPedge (100% VoIP) (NEW).</h3>
<h4>Both are current and will continue to evolve.</h4>
<h4>Both can be networked and to each other.</h4>

<p><b>Which product is right for you?</b><br />
With the launch of IPedge, Toshiba will be carrying and supporting two separate and complimentary
product lines, IPedge and Strata CIX systems. IPedge is a software centric platform designed for
customers who want to deploy on an all IP network infrastructure to realize the savings of managing a
single network. Strata CIX40, CIX100, CIX200, CIX670 and CIX1200 systems continue to provide
excellent converged solutions for customers who want a mix of IP, digital, and analog endpoint devices
connected to their system along with IP telephony applications. IPedge and Strata CIX solutions can also
work together as networked systems.</p>


<p>The IPedge user experience is similar to a high end implementation of CIX with several external servers.
   The IPedge 1U servers are capable of 200 or 1000 users. This single    linux based server combines the
   features of the Strata CIX PBX, Strata Messaging Voice Mail, Stata Call Manager GUI, and Strata Meeting
   Audio and Web Conferencing.  This allows you access to many large system features in a smaller priced system.
   A 3rd smaller server has a max of 40 users and does not offer Audio and Web Conferencing.</p>

<p>The CIX comes prepackaged with 2 years of warranty and support with optional 5 and 7 year hardware warranty options and requires
no annual maintenance.  The IPEdge comes with one year support and then requires annual maintenance (like most other manufactuers these
days). </p>

<h2>Toshiba Strata CIX Family of Telephone Systems:</h2>
<p>Toshiba offers five Strata CIX systems which share the same software feature set but differ only in their maximum configuration size.
Toshiba has a non-blocking architecture design that means every telephone can be used at once without power, CPU, or path limitations.
Base cost is determined by maximum size permitted.  The family members overlap in sizing and most use a license strategy where capacity
is unlocked as you need it.  This allows you to grow without having to pay for growth until you need it.</p>
