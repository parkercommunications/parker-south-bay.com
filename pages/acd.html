<h1>Call Centers (ACD)</h1>
<h5>(all agents are busy, your call will be answered in the order received...)</h5><br />

  <div id=body>

  	<p>Parker Communications and Toshiba offer a multitude of products, options and services to enhance the value,
  		flexibility, and effectiveness of your Toshiba communications system.</p>

  	<p> Call Center(s) exist in many companies.  A Call Center application is used when you have a group of outside
  		callers who wish to wait for an individual or next available agent instead of going to voice mail.  The
  		typical greeting on an ACD (Automated Call Distribution) is "We’re sorry, all agents are busy. Please hold
  		and your call will be answered by the next available agent."  </p>

  	<p> The ACD is the heart of a Call Center.  It keeps track of the incoming calls and how to present those calls
  		to busy individuals or groups.  It handles everything from the simplest first in/first out cases to the
  		more complex application where priority is given to VIP customers.  Toshiba’s ACD can be as simple or as
  		powerful as any in the industry. Toshiba’s advanced (enhanced agents) are just a bit more expensive than
  		the standard agent so usually we just include it.  Toshiba systems are server based (You may use your own
  		dedicated server or share the Toshiba MAS Voice Mail Server).  Pricing is based on the number of possible
  		agents (starts at 10 agents, 1 supervisor) and NOT on the number of groups (Toshiba has unlimited groups).</p>

  	<p>	Toshiba’s ACD reporting (reports, statistics, etc) is optional and priced separately.  Toshiba interfaces with
  		two world class suppliers of ACD reporting software, TASKE and Insight (SENSION).  	Introductory pricing
  		promos often exist.  Ask your Parker sales engineer.</p>
