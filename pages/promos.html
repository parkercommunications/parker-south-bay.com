	<h4><b>True TDM ISDN PRImary rate interface phone service for less than $349 per month</b></h4>
		<p>Get from California’s 3rd largest phone company the best audio and most versatil
		phone service (TDM ISDN PRI) available in our industry for the lowestprice yet!
		Includes porting of your up to 20 of your existing numbers (more possible) and a new
		block of 100 contiguous numbers for direct line to each extension, department, company, fax, etc..
		Full 23 channel (23 calls in or out at a time). Perfect for letting your Toshiba PBX split out analog lines
		with out extra monthly costs.  Can be doubled to create 46 simulaneous call capability.
		Includes inbound numeric and alpha Caller-ID on Toshiba display phones and passed to Toshiba Netphone
		GUI. The first 1000 minutes are free.  Local calls are 1.9 cents first minute and 0.7 cents for additional
		minutes.  Long Distance or 800 inbound service is 3.0 cents per minutes.  Can be used with the the
		PRI card rebate offer below.  3 year term required. Call us!</p>

		<h4><b>Quality VoIP Based phone service </b></h4>
		<p>Need more free minutes?  Don't need 23 lines? Do not have a need for modems! Your PBX can not do PRI?
		Consider VoIP based phone service.
		Since this ISP is also the 3rd largest phone company in California their VoIP has QOS and works well.  Not like
		VoIP based phone services that pass over the general internet that gives choppy speech.  VoIP is almost always a
		compromise to TDM quality, but in this case it is a very acceptable trade off.  An example would be a 1.5MB T1
		for data with 8 channels of voice (analog or PRI).  Faxes can exit the edge router with reliable results. T1's can
		be bonded for 3M, 4.5M, etc.  Ask us!
