			<h1 class="blue">OLD TOSHIBA SYSTEMS:</h1>
			<p>
				Recently, a customer told us that the phone guy whom they had used for years had gone out of business because of the bad economy.  When they called another
				local authorized dealer, they were informed that they only had one tech available to deal with the older Toshiba systems and he was booked for several weeks.
				Then they called us. With several techs with over 25 years of Toshiba experience and a supply of used parts we can easily service the older
				Toshiba product.  Older Toshiba is still viable and we can support it without requiring an upgrade, replacement, or putting a maintenance contract
				on your system.  Of course, we can usually offer several levels of upgrade to stabilize or modernize your system now or over time.  We'd be happy to discuss servicing
				your older Toshiba system.

						<p>4/26/13: Update VIPedge doc to include Call Manager Mobile (Smart Phone Apps for Android &amp; iPhone).</p>

									<p>4/4/13: CIX Application Server: The CIX Application Server marrys the traditional CIX PBX line with Toshiba's VoIP IPedge/VIPedge product line.  We now
										have the choice of CIX application server(s) (typically flat pricing) or the IPedge application "All-in-One" server (priced per user).
										Interestingly, these servers (3 sizes) can grow into full IPedge systems by applying the proper licensing.<p>

											<p>This can add many
												big features to a small system at a very economical price. Initially this includes Voice Mail, Strata Call Manager (GUI), and Meeting: Audio
												Conference bridge, web conferences, and video conferencing (separate or all 3 in a single session). We speculate that ACD will follow shortly.
												Toshiba will start shipping these on April 8th (We had a head start and we are installing our first one now).<p>

													<p> Toshiba's Buy 2 Phones, get the 3rd phone March Promo was so successful they ran out of 11 models of phones for 10 days. Don't worry
														we still have inventory!

														<p>
															Recent Interest:  Cell phone clients, VIPedge CLOUD based systems, Cordless Phones that share multiple bases (roaming) over a large
															facility (up to 40 access points).</p>
