<h1 style="color:blue">OLD TOSHIBA SYSTEMS:</h1>

Recently, a customer told us that the phone guy whom they had used for years had gone out of business because of the bad economy.  When they called another
local authorized dealer, they were informed that they only had one tech available to deal with the older Toshiba systems and he was booked for several weeks.
Then they called us. With several techs with over 25 years of Toshiba experience and a supply of used parts we can easily service the older
Toshiba product.  Older Toshiba is still viable and we can support it without requiring an upgrade, replacement, or putting a maintenance contract
on your system.  Of course, we can usually offer several levels of upgrade to stabilize or modernize your system now or over time.  We'd be happy to discuss servicing
your older Toshiba system.
