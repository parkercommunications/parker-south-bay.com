<h1>Why Use an Authorized Dealer?</h1>

<b>What is an Toshiba Authorized Dealer?</b><br />
	Toshiba has an authorized dealer program to guarantee that every Toshiba system sold is the best it can be.  Authorized dealers are the only legal
	source of purchasing new Toshiba Telecom equipment in the USA.  Toshiba has authorized fewer than 500 dealers across the United States.  There
	are fewer than a dozen in the San Francisco Bay Area.  Toshiba requires a substantial amount of product to be sold by authorized dealers each
	quarter to guarantee their familiarity with the product.  Dealerships must maintain repair stock, honor warranties, and provide prompt emergency
	service.  Dealers are only allowed to sell in their territory and are required to install everything they sell.  This policy prohibits internet
	sales outside of a dealer's territory AND no system can be sold for resale.  Only authorized dealers may take Toshiba training and certification,
	access factory tech support, or purchase and sell Toshiba telecom equipment in the USA.

<br /> <b>What are the pitfalls of using a un-authorized dealer?</b><br />
           There are dozens of un-authorized dealers in the Bay Area.  Anyone with some phone knowledge can purchase used and often obsolete systems
           and components and resell them.  However, the equipment that is in the used market tends to be old, obsolete, frequently flakey, stolen,
           or illegally imported from other countries (may or may not be completely compatible).  Almost all current products now have serial numbers
           that are electronically readable.  Authorized Toshiba dealers and Toshiba can now determine who originally sold the equipment and if it is
           legal or not.  Using any non-legal equipment in your systems voids all Toshiba warranties as does having an unauthorized company service
           your Toshiba system.  Unauthorized dealers have no access to factory tech support, documentation, updates, etc.  They often provide out of
           date solutions, buggy software (since they have no access to corrected software fixes), and lack the  training to properly service your
           equipment.  Unauthorized dealers or individuals are unable to add licensing to expand your Toshiba system beyond its current size and can
           be potentially found out once this occurs.  There is no reliable source for these folks as Toshiba's legal department is always closing in
           on them and their supply chain.
