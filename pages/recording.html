<h1>Call Recording</h1>

  <div id=body><p>Toshiba offers call recording on several levels:
	Call recording can be a convenience for occasional use or a critical part of your business.  Many companies today are saving all emails and phone calls forever.  A single recording might pay for the entire system for business critical recordings such as insurance companies.
	<p>For example:
	Customer:  "I added that car to my million dollar policy."
	Agent: "No, you asked for a quote but wanted to compare others first before confirming.  Let me play a recording
	of that call."
	Occasional users might wish to record a complex order or a customer complaint or requirement.
