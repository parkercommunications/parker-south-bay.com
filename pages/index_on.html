	Beta Program.  We test Toshiba's newest products and get to give our input back to development before other Toshiba Dealers
	even hear about the product.  We are sworn to secrecy of what Toshiba is working on next but we can tell you we were
	recently involved with the R4 CIX processor, CIX40 System, the Web Callback application, and the Strata Messaging Voice Mail on LUCA.</p>

<p>Located in the San Francisco Bay Area, we service the greater Bay Area from Sacramento to San Luis Obispo and everywhere in between.
We also manage and serve our national clients across the United States through the Toshiba National Account program.</p>
