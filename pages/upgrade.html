<h1>Upgrade Your Existing Toshiba System</h1>
<div id=body>
<p>Toshiba's successful strategy has been to offer a phone system that is "green" with both forward and backwards compatibility.
This allows upgrade options to be tailored to your needs, both business and financial.
Parker Communications has been an authorized Toshiba Dealer for over 18 years.
Key employees have been servicing Toshiba since the late 1980s.  Most of the systems from the 80's and 90's have been updated
with more modern systems.  With Toshiba's famous reliability, most systems are replaced to introduce more modern features as
compared to old age failure. Many thrifty companies still use their early, faithful Toshiba systems.</p>

<p><b>Parker upgrade rule #1:</b>  Do your Toshiba Phones have a red or gray HOLD button?</p>

<p><b>Red:</b> Phone(s) are 1992 or newer that are digital or VoIP and can be placed on any new Toshiba system.</p>

<p><b>Gray:</b> Phone(s) are 1991 or older that are electronic and cannot be placed on a new Toshiba digital or VoIP system.
However, you still have the option of expanding your system with new (as inventory exists) and refurbished, out of production parts.</p>

<p><b>Non-Toshiba Upgrades:</b><br />
Recently many businesses have been tempted by cheap or "free" internet phone systems.   They often have Polycom VoIP SIP endpoints (telephone sets).
Now that you have determined why these systems were cheap or "free" and you need a solution that can actually keep you in business,
let us help you. By popular demand Toshiba has allowed much of the Polycom telephone set line to be attached to the Toshiba system.
This can save you significant money in not having to replace your telephone sets. These sets can attach and function well with the Toshiba systems.
However, you should know that Toshiba endpoints (telephone sets) usually offer a lot more features.
The good news is that you can keep the Polycom sets for simple uses and accommodate power users with Toshiba phones.</p>
