<h1>Parker can sell, service, and discount Toshiba Telecommunications Equipment anywhere in the US</h1>
<br>
<h3>Have Multiple Sites?  We offer single point of contact solutions.</h3>
  <div id=body><p>If you have multiple locations either locally or around the country, we can service each of your locations providing you with a single point of contact.
  Sites located throughout the US can be serviced through the Toshiba National Accounts program.  This program is one of the best in the industry and Parker Communications makes it even better.
  Under this program one dealership initially sells the equipment as a single point of contact working with local, authorized Toshiba National Account dealers to install, program, and support the system.</p>

	<p>Parker takes this a step farther by programming all of your systems and then providing remote maintenance and support.
	 Parker sends installation supplies and detailed install instructions to the local dealers thereby keeping all of the physical installs similar and in line with the higher Parker standard.
	 Your programming will have the same look and feel at all of your sites, allowing easier user migration and simpler, one call customer support.
	Of course, when there is an issue that cannot be solved remotely, we will dispatch the local authorized Toshiba National Account Dealer.</p>
