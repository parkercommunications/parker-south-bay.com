<h2>Toshiba IPedge Family of Telephone Systems:</h2>

<p>Parker was in the second group of 10 to Beta the IPedge.  Parker was the first dealership to become PLATINUM for Sales Training
and the first dealership to become certified at the top technical level.</p>

<p>Toshiba offers 3 IPedge systems which share the same software feature set but differ mostly in their
maximum configuration size.   The family members overlap in sizing and use a license strategy where capacity and features are
unlocked as you need them.  This allows you to grow without having to pay for growth until you need it.</p>


<h3>Toshiba has 3 IPedge phone system models to fit your needs</h3><br />
