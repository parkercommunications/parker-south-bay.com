<h1>Telecom in the 2011 Economy</h1>
  <div id=body>
  <br />
  <h3>The economy being what it is, times are tough. Parker Communications can help</h3>

<p><b>We can arrange a lease for your new system or upgrade:</b>
    Get the system you need at a price you can afford.  Spread your payments over 24-63 months.  Your choice of Fair Market Value (15% buyout cap), $1 buyout, or 10% buyout.  Also choice of zero down or 2 payments down.  Subject to credit approval.  See Promos !!!<p>

<p><b>Discounts and Promos' on new equipment:</b>
	Parker sales engineers are not directly commissioned on each sale.  Happy, loyal customers provide our salaries.  We will take the time to educate ourselves about your business and assist you in selecting the best Toshiba for your company and means.  We will ensure that you receive the advantage of promos and discounts available.<p>

<p><b>Eliminate maintence contract costs:</b>
	Parker offers 2 years onsite warranty on parts and labor of new Toshiba system installs.  We also offer factory extensions of the parts warranty to 5 or 7 years.  Many brands and many Toshiba dealers require an active maintenance contract to receive the support you deserve.  These typically cost 10-20 percent of the purchase price on new systems and even more on aging systems.  Most Parker clients enjoy peace of mind without monthly maintenance payments.  We also provide service and support to systems purchased from others.<p>

<p><b>Non profit discounts:</b>
	Parker Communications offers discounts to non-profits.  We will need a  copy of your tax exempt certificate as well as an itemized list of equipment purchased written on your company letterhead.

<p><b>System management (free your employees from telecom management):</b>
	We administrate all of the adds, moves, and changes for most of our clients remotely.  The Toshiba system is as powerful as they come with thousands of options.  It takes time and money to train administrators and often the knowledge is lost with infrequent usage and staff turnover.  Let us get the job done quickly and efficiently as well as give your system a checkup each time we do maintenance.

<p><b>Downsizing:</b>
	Many companies are downsizing or “rightsizing” during these economic times.  Let us help you by performing audits of phone lines and phone equipment. Often people “downsize” too much on the first pass and find it costs a bundle to add back some of the previous services.  Let Parker help you select the proper amount and make you aware of the risks.  Don’t lose sales from orders being left in voice mail boxes no longer being checked.  Have us clean up your phone system and voice mail.  Perhaps you have excess space that you could rent to a tenant.  We can configure your phone and voicemail system to accommodate this tenant allowing you to benefit from the additional income.
Phone Line and Toll costs Audit:
	Let us help you make sure you are not paying too much to the phone companies each month.  We often can find a way to decrease your monthly bill or increase your phone company service without costing much (like adding direct numbers to each employee).  If it has been a while since you have performed such an audit you could be paying way too much for your phone service.  Parker and Toshiba are ready to help you with connectivity for all types of service such as analog, digital, ISDN, PRI, VoIP, and the newest SIP services.

<p><b>Factory Refurbished Parts upon request:</b>
	Upon request, we can configure systems or upgrades using factory refurbished parts with a 1 year factory warranty.

<p><b>Equipment trading:</b>
	In tough times, we may be able to trade your surplus for some of our surplus allowing you to reduce out of pocket costs while still upgrading your system.

<p><b>Used components:</b>
	We prefer to work with all new Toshiba components, but we would
rather you have a used Toshiba solution than no solution at all.  If this interests you, let your sales engineer know so they can research current inventories and discounts as an alternative.

<p><b>Older components:</b>
	We prefer to work with all new and current Toshiba components, however we might be able to get you into a new modern core Toshiba with some older used (some new) components at substantial discount.  An example of this would be using older CO trunk cards that would not be appropriate in VoIP settings, but could be used in a digital environment in a VoIP ready system.

<p><b>Simplified installation and programming:</b>
	Parker Communications prides itself in being able to tailor a Toshiba configuration for your company to maximize the benefit that can be derived from the Toshiba feature set for your business.  An example of this is to have direct private line calls ring with a different ring tone than other types of calls ringing on your phone.  Upon request, we can discount our normal installation and forgo some of the niceties other dealers often don’t provide.

<p><b>Remote maintenance:</b>
	Parker Communications customer service personnel are experts at remote maintenance.  This saves you money:
	+ by eliminating  expense of sending a technician to your site.
	+ reducing labor minimum to 0.25 hours vs 1 hour minimum
	+ remote labor can often be scheduled before on-site trips.
	+ use your eyes, ears, and hands and our expertise to get
			up and running faster when system down or degraded.

<p><p><b>Possible Tax Credits:</b>
	We are not acting as a tax consultant but are bringing additional value to 	the transaction to help you possibly save money.
	As always, check with your CPA to confirm the benefits to you.

	Economic Stimulus Act of 2008 (Section 179)
	The President and House legislators have agreed on the basic policy objectives for boosting the US economy in the hopes of warding off a recession.  Government economists hope that the plan will provide an "effective, robust, and temporary set of incentives that will boost our economy and encourage job creation."  The plan will provide a tax incentive for businesses to invest in fixed assets such as machinery and equipment.
	The Economic Stimulus Act of 2008 provides incentives to businesses.  The short and sweet of it is that your business can write off up to $250,000 of section 179 property purchased this year.  This includes software purchases that are usually written off in three to five years.
<p><p><b>Example….</b>
	Purchase a $10,000 telephone system or CCTV system and you could recover about 35% (depending on actual tax bracket) the first year.  In this case the net cost to you would be $6,500 for a $10,000 system.
	This is a temporary offer by our government to stimulate growth…you should take advantage of it now.
	<p>Bonus 50% depreciation for asset purchases -  Businesses 	could save approximately $50 billion in near-term taxes through a temporary change to the tax code that will allow American businesses that buy new equipment this year to deduct an additional 50 percent of the cost of their investment in 2008.  This will encourage businesses to expand and create new jobs now because buying equipment, software, and tangible property this year will dramatically lower their taxes.  The agreement also increases expensing for small businesses.
	<p> Expensing limits under Section 179 - Businesses will be able to deduct up to $250,000 of the cost of new assets, double the $125,000 dollar limit in effect for 2007.  Section 179 is a tax provision that gives business owners the option of either deducting the cost of new assets right away, or spreading out the cost over time using depreciation methods.  Both the bonus depreciation and the higher Section 179 limits in effect encourages businesses to purchase computers, telecommunications equipment, 	machinery, and other assets.
	Provided for 2008 tax preparations.
	Check with your CPA to deternine if there is a 2009 advantage for you.

	<p><b>United States Small Business Jobs Act of 2010</b></p>
	<p>The recently enacted 2010 Small Business Jobs Act includes a wide-ranging assortment of tax breaks
		and incentives for businesses. Here's a brief overview of the tax changes in the Small Business Jobs
		Act re Section 179 and Bonus Depreciation.
	</p>
	<p><b>Enhanced small business expensing (Section 179 expensing).</b></p>
	<p>	To help small businesses quickly recover the cost of capital outlays, small business taxpayers
		can elect to write off these expenditures in the year they are made instead of recovering them
		through depreciation. Under the old rules,  taxpayers could generally expense up to $250,000
		of qualifying property—generally, machinery, equipment and software—placed in service in during
		the tax year. This annual limit was reduced by the amount by which the cost of property placed
		in service exceeded $800,000. Under the Small Business Jobs Act, for tax years beginning in 2010
		and 2011, the $250,000 limit is increased to $500,000 and the investment limit to $2,000,000.
		The Small Business Jobs Act also makes certain real property eligible for expensing. Thus, for
		property placed in service in any tax year beginning in 2010 or 2011, the $500,000 amount can
		include up to $250,000 of qualified leasehold improvement, restaurant and retail improvement property.
		Extension of 50% bonus first-year depreciation. Before the Small Business Jobs Act, Congress already
		allowed businesses to more rapidly deduct capital expenditures of most new tangible personal
		property placed in service in 2008 or 2009 by permitting the first-year write-off of 50% of the cost.
		The Small Business Jobs Act extends the first-year 50% write-off to apply to qualifying property placed
		in service in 2010 (as well as 2011 for certain aircraft and long production period property).
		Please consult with your tax professional for further clarification re the impact of the new laws on
		your individual situation.

	<p><b>American with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA)</b>
	The following is a brief overview of the Disabled Access Credit from the ADA (American 	Disabilities Act).  Keep in mind that nobody at the company has to have a hearing impairment in order to qualify, and always check with your CPA about form 8826 regarding these tax situations:

	<p>1. Eligible small business w/ prior year gross receipts < $1 million OR no 	more than 30 full time employees are allowed 50% credit for disabled 	access expenditures exceeding $250 up to $10,000 maximum. Disabled
	Access Credit is included as a General Business Credit, and as such is subject to the limitations on the amount that can be utilized in any given year.

	<p>2. Disabled access expenditures include amounts paid or incurred
		<br>a) Removing architectural, communication, physical or transportation 			barriers
		<br>b) Providing qualified interpreters or other effective methods of making 			aurally delivered materials available to individuals with hearing impairments
		<br>c) Providing qualified readers, taped texts, and other effective methods of 		making visually delivered materials available to individuals with visual 			impairments
		<br>d) Acquiring or modifying equipment or devices for individuals with 			disabilities
		<br>e) Providing other similar services, modifications, materials or equipment.
<br>
	The disabled access expenditures must be for the purpose of enabling such small business to comply with the applicable requirements of the Americans With Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA). As discussed on Oct 21, 1997, since the telephone system includes all components necessary to utilize the TDD function, the equipment is eligible for the Disabled Access 	Credit under point 2(b) above.
