<h1>Toshiba Voice Over IP (VoIP)</h1>
  <div id=body>
	<br />
	<h4>What is all the hype about VoIP?</h4>
	<p>Voice over IP (VoIP) has been the big buzzword and bandwagon in telecom since dot com and the millennium.</p>
	<ul>
   		<li>Telephone carriers like VoIP because it costs them less.</li>
  		<li>PBX manufacturers love VoIP because it costs them less to produce and develop.</li>
  		<li>Equipment sellers love VoIP because customers will pay a premium for what they think is newer and better.</li>
  		<li>Customers love VoIP because:
  			<ul>
  				<li>Allows offsite users.</li>
  				<li>Allows linking of multiple phone systems.</li>
  				<li>Gives the full power of the "company" telephone to the remote user.</li>
  				<li>Significantly lowers montly toll or line costs as milage increases.</li>
  			</ul>
  		</li>
  	</ul>

  <p>Ask Parker Communications to analyze your particular application to see if VoIP or non-VoIP or some combination
  of the two makes the most sense for your business.  <b>Toshiba models can be configured as VoIP, non-VoIp, or any
  mixture of the two</b>, and can be upgraded or modified now or in the future as your requirements evolve.</p>

  <p><b>What is VoIP?</b> VoIP (voice over internet protocol) uses your computer data network and the internet to connect
  		the phones to the phone system or the phone system to other phone systems.  VoIP can also connect your system to the
  		phone company using SIP trunking.  SIP trunking is usually delivered on a data circuit that allows you to get internet
  		and phone service on the same circuit.</p>


  <p><b>What is the alternative to VoIP?</b> Before VoIP, the leading business PBX manufacturers and the telephone
  		companies (Telco) used dedicated digital circuits between them.  This allowed perfect "hear the pin drop"
  		digital speech.  What was transmitted was heard at the other end immediately.</p>

  <p><b>Does Parker and Toshiba do VoIP or TDM?</b>  We both do both!  The Toshiba system can be 100% VoIP or 100% TDM
  		(traditional phone service) or any combination  in between with the same model system.  VoIP/TDM configuration
		can be changed at any time before or after system installation.</p>

  <p><b>Should we buy a VoIP system?</b> Today, generally speaking, you should NOT buy a VOIP only system.
  		The same can be said for NOT buying a TDM only 	system.  You need a system that can do both.  Often, all
  		the phones in the building should be digital.  	Additional buildings close by should be linked with digital
  		TDM ISDN PRIs.  At some distance the monthly cost will 	be too much and it then makes sense to use VoIP to
  		connect them.   Whether the additional sites(s) have VoIP off 	the primary PBX or are linked PBX’s is a
  		design question.  Single or a small groups of offsite users usually require VoIP.</p>

  <p><b>There are exceptions to any rule.</b> For example, The "IP Mobility" feature allows a user with multiple VoIP phones
  		(home, office, laptop) to log in at a different location and "bump" off his previous location.   Using Digital
  		phones you would have 2 separate extensions and have calls ring at both at the same time (not quite the same
  		experience and has less flexibility)  Let a Parker sales engineer help you reach the optimum configuration.</p>

  <p><b>Does VoIP or TDM offer more features?</b> Today the user experience of a VoIP phone and a TDM phone are almost the same.  Today, when features are too
		complex for a telephone set, features extend to the users PC graphical user interface (GUI).  However, both VoIP
		and TDM systems can	do this for the power users.  Somewhere in the future, it is conceivable that the amount
		of information being delivered to the desk set will require VoIP or perhaps give rise to the TDM/IP hybrid.</p>

  <p><b>Does VoIP give you better quality speech than TDM?</b>VoIP on its best day can only give 95 percent of what TDM can deliver.  There are many pitfalls with VoIP that
		lower its quality.  These pitfalls result in same symptom that 	cellphones have"choppy speech".  These pitfalls
		can occur on any link of the VoIP chain and are often intermittent, involve many vendors, and can be very
		expensive to resolve.</p>

  <p><b>How is speech sent?</b> The standard for all telephone speech starts off with sampling 	the microphone 8,000
  		times a second and generating a number between 0 and 255.  This is 64,000 bits per second or 8,000 bytes per
  		second. TDM guarantees that every one of these bits is sent promptly from one end to the other.  Once the call
  		is answered, nothing can interfere with the quality or flow until one of the callers hang up. VoIP takes these
  		8,000 bytes of information and sends them raw OR uses an algorithm to compress the 8,000 to 1,000 to 4,000 or so.
  		It then sends 20-150 of these bytes at a time with 40 bytes of overhead.  This means you need about 84K of up/down
  		bandwidth for corded, TDM sound quality. </p>

  	<p> With VoIP, the data paths are usually shared.  VoIP packets are subject to traffic delays and loss.  Since late
  		data is useless it is discarded, resulting in choppy speech.  Quality of Service (QOS) internal
  		to your site can be controlled with more expensive data network equipment and support or separate voice and data
  		networks.  QOS between sites uses expensive MPLS (requires same data provider) or a large bandwidth.  Routers
  		having bandwidth management or separate voice and data neworks are suggested. </p>

  <p><b>Does VoIP really save in cabling costs?</b> Some would say you would save money with a VoIP system when you have
  		to install all new cabling.  There is a term "one wire to the desk" where VoIP manufacturers build a mini-switch
  		into the bottom of the phone (Toshiba’s have this feature and with a 1GB speed).  You would think all you would
  		have to do is plug your PCs into the phone and all would be good.  This requires the very latest in quality
  		routers that will route DIFFSERVE and/or the setup of Virtual Lans.  Once you start down the VLAN path there
  		is costly switch programming and user discipline is required as the jacks in the switch are no longer all the
  		same.  Many top installers of VoIP simply have the customer run 2 data cables so voice and data are separate.<p>

  <p>TDM uses almost any twisted pair telecom cable.  Most small companies who simply want to move into where another
  		tenant was before, will not have to re-cable with TDM.  There can be 	problems running on "QUAD" cabling.
  		Quad cabling has 4 conductors with out being twisted and has conductors with red, green, yellow, and black
  		coloring. It is NOT a twisted pair cable.  It is often found in older buildings or originally installed for
  		alarm systems.</p>

  <p><b>Which is costlier to maintain and/or more reliable?</b> TDM problems are easy to diagnose.  There are only 3
  		things that typically go wrong and only the Telephone vendor is involved.  There is no interaction with any
  		other telephone circuit since each path is unique and separate.  TDM networking (using point to point PRIs
  		using T1s ) are multi-vendor but have self testing and fault detection built in.</p>
  <p>	VoIP is much harder and costlier to diagnose.  Any device on the network or the Internet can be the problem.
  		All activity of VoIP and non-VoIP equipment can be the source of the issues.  There are dozens of interacting
  		intermittent possibilities. There can be lots of equipment, companies, and programming involved.  Expensive
  		network assessments costs thousands for a couple of hours of testing that may or may not see your intermittent
  		issue. Lots of finger pointing possibilities exist.</p>

  <p><b>Power Failures and VoIP:</b> VoIP requires electrical power in many places to work.  Each phone needs a power
  		with a cube OR expensive Power Over Ethernet (POE) switches.  The PBX, all switches, Routers, ISP edge equipment
  		-  they all need electrical power.  You must provide battery backup at every location where one of these devices
  		resides.<p>

  <p>TDM systems often have a single battery backup device.  The PBX supplies power to all of its phones.  The phone
  		company powers both TDM analog and digital circuits.</p>

  <p><b>SIP trunking uses VoIP to connect your phone system to a phone company.</b>  Most often, the circuit also delivers your
  internet data connection.  For QOS (Quality of Service (non choppy speech)) you need to get your data circuit direct from
  the phone company providing the SIP trunks or the internet company must have a relationship with the particular phone company.
  Using the general internet to deliver SIP trunking is very problematic.  SIP trunking typically compress the normal 64K bandwidth
  to 28K.  Since it throws out all but the center of the voice frequency ranges, faxes and modems do not generally work.  Some carriers
  offer a special port on their edge router with 64K bandwidth for faxes.  Each ongoing voice call subtracts 28K from
  the capacity of the circuit.  Pricing and need usually determine the maximum number of simultenous calls.  SIP is always a compromise
  to a true TDM PRI.  It offers PRI like features with reduced quality.  Let Parker engineers help you decide what is best for your business.</p>

  <p>Phone companies, including the local public utility, AT&T, are pushing VoIP to save themselves money at the expense of the quality
  of your phone service.  You may ask for a traditional PRI circuit but may end up with VoIP SIP trunks with an edge device converting it into a
  PRI look-a-like.  Once you reach your phone compnay, a SIP call will most likly be passed to the far end via that company's B network (not
  as good as their A network (digital 64K TDM - like a PRI)).

  <p>SIP trunking is brand new technology.  The standard is more like a guideline. Not everyone plays well together.  Toshiba has certified
   the following companies with the Toshiba Phone Systems: American Broadband Services, AT&T, AireSpring, Broadcore, Broadvox, CBeyond,
   ClearFly, Everest Broadband, Iptimize, Level 3, Line Systems, MM Internet, nTelos, New Global Telecom, PAETEC, POPP.com,
   Select Connect Communications, Smart Choice, SoTel Systems, TelePacific, Twist Networks, Xchange Telecom, and XO Communications.</p>
